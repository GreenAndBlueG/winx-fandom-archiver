# `winx.fandom.com` archiver
This repo contains a github actions pipeline that weekly archives every page in Winx' totally unofficial wiki

## Why?
[winx.fandom.com](https://winx.fandom.com/] contains an infinite ammount of informations about everything releated to the Winx Club franchise.
The problem is that it's currently been hosted by Fandom which can destroy the whole wiki at any moment they want.

The goal of the repo is the automaticaly backup with everything in a place is secure from some company's `delete` button
